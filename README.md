Purpose

&quot;Currently, we&#39;re working on the first part of the mission: to create and populate a knowledge base that defines patient cohorts and insights relevant to them by parsing &quot;open&quot; patient discussion forums.&quot; ~ Rebecca Zhuo

Goals

  Week 1:

   Populate a knowledge base that _defines_ patient cohorts and insights relevant to them by parsing &quot;open&quot; patient discussion forums.
   
   **Assignment Posted**: Google Drive/Shared with me/KnowNowVolunteer/#software/Week 1

   1. Select appropriate patient cohorts&#39; sites. Here are some examples:

      - [NCCN guidelines for breast cancer](https://knownow-group.slack.com/team/UK1BN6EUT)
      - [NCI](https://knownow-group.slack.com/team/UK1BN6EUT)
      - [FDA](https://open.fda.gov/)
      - [Oncotype DX](https://www.oncotypeiq.com/en-US/breast-cancer/healthcare-professionals/oncotype-dx-breast-recurrence-score/about-the-test)
      - [Lymph Node Status](https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/LymphNodeStatusandStaging.html)
      - [Surgical margins and Guide to breast cancer pathology report](https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/margins)

   1. Web scrape and store the raw contents.
   2. Find a distributive mean of storing the data and outputting its raw results.

      - Find relationships and organization of the subject.
      - Select the appropriate database to deliver the results.
      - Organize and structure the nature of the contents.


  Week 2: _Likely to be updated closer to the start the week_

   - Find similarities among the content and relationships.
   - Classify cohort properties as tags with relevant patient insight.
   - Provide relevancy data in a manipulatable way.

  Week 3: _Likely to be updated closer to the start the week_

   Combine the results with data science group to define the application. Afterwards, provide details to the graphical user interface team for implementation. Learn the patient&#39;s lifestyle and mold the design to fit their needs. 
  
   - Key important structure of the application: immediate results and as much decluttering as possible.
   - Schedule a meeting with the Data Science team and trade research.
   - Draw up designs and implementation GUI goals.
      1. Decide on the major tools required and prioritize them of importance.
      2. Test the application and debug

  Week 4: _Likely to be updated closer to the start the week_

Extra leeway for errors. In a project some extra room for errors is to be expected. This week will be for anything the rolls over before the deadline.

   - Debugging
   - Testing
   - Human Trials
   - Deployment

**Team Meetings**

Every week there will be a When2Meet link posted on Slack on the #Software channel. Please provide your available times in which we can best accommodate our weekly meetings. These meetings are for you to provide us with feedback with your ongoing progress and for us to collectively link our work with yours. If any issues were to arise in your progress, you&#39;ll have the support of your team during these sessions.

**Advisory Meetings**

It&#39;s ideal to meet with an advisory committee after certain milestones have been completed. These meetings will be held on a [daily/weekly] basis after [milestone name(s)] have been completed. They will be scheduled preferably during the same day we have our team meetings. They are not mandatory but can provide you with a different insight from other professionals. We will schedule all meetings through Calendly or email with the appropriate advisor:

# TimeBudget

Development is currently on a sprint. We have until August 28 to deliver our final prototype.
